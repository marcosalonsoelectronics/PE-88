Material of video PE #88: Avoiding Pitfalls in MOSFET Switching Loss Calculation (I)

Available at: https://youtu.be/ewliivpMLiA

This video explores procedures to calculate the switching losses of MOSFET transistors. In this first part we review the turn-on and turn-off switching processes in detail, showing demonstrative Qspice simulations. It is also seen how the equation based on the output capacitance is not accurate enough to calculate the switching losses. In the second part a procedure to calculate the losses from the manufacturer's datasheet information will be presented.
